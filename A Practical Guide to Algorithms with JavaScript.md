### **Time** Complexity

How many primitive ***operations*** are executed?

### **Space** Complexity

How much ***memory*** is used?

| Big-O, name       | # of Operations | Algorithm                        |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| O(n^2), quadratic | n^2             | compare all numbers              |
| O(n), linear      | 2n              | Find min and max numbers         |
| O(1), constant    | 2               | Sorted list, find first and last |
