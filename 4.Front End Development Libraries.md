# Front End Development Libraries

Now that you're familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, level up your skills by learning some of the most popular front end libraries in the industry.

In the Front End Libraries Certification, you'll learn how to style your site quickly with Bootstrap. You'll also learn how add logic to your CSS styles and extend them with Sass.

Later, you'll build a shopping cart and other applications to learn how to create powerful Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React and Redux.





## **React**

React is a popular JavaScript library for building reusable, component-driven user interfaces for web pages or applications.

React combines HTML with JavaScript functionality into its own markup language called JSX. React also makes it easy to manage the flow of data throughout the application.

In this course, you'll learn how to create different React components, manage data in the form of state props, use different lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, and much more.



### **Create a Simple JSX Element**

React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. It's a great tool to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This has several benefits. It lets you use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. For the most part, JSX is similar to the HTML that you have already learned, however there are a few key differences that will be covered throughout these challenges.

For instance, because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX. To do this, you simply include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: `{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }`. Keep this in mind, since it's used in several future challenges.

However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process. For your convenience, it's already added behind the scenes for these challenges. If you happen to write syntactically invalid JSX, you will see the first test in these challenges fail.

It's worth noting that under the hood the challenges are calling `ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))`. This function call is what places your JSX into React's own lightweight representation of the DOM. React then uses snapshots of its own DOM to optimize updating only specific parts of the actual DOM.



### **Create a Complex JSX Element**

The last challenge was a simple example of JSX, but JSX can represent more complex HTML as well.

One important thing to know about nested JSX is that it must return a single element.

This one parent element would wrap all of the other levels of nested elements.

For instance, several JSX elements written as siblings with no parent wrapper element will not transpile.

Here's an example:

**Valid JSX:**

```jsx
<div>
  <p>Paragraph One</p>
  <p>Paragraph Two</p>
  <p>Paragraph Three</p>
</div>
```

**Invalid JSX:**

```jsx
<p>Paragraph One</p>
<p>Paragraph Two</p>
<p>Paragraph Three</p>
```



### **Add Comments in JSX**

JSX is a syntax that gets compiled into valid JavaScript. Sometimes, for readability, you might need to add comments to your code. Like most programming languages, JSX has its own way to do this.

To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax `{/* */}` to wrap around the comment text.



### **Render HTML Elements to the DOM**

So far, you've learned that JSX is a convenient tool to write readable HTML within JavaScript. With React, we can render this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as ReactDOM.

ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: `ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)`, where the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.

As you would expect, `ReactDOM.render()` must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them.



### **Define an HTML Class in JSX**Passed

Now that you're getting comfortable writing JSX, you may be wondering how it differs from HTML.

So far, it may seem that HTML and JSX are exactly the same.

One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word `class` to define HTML classes. This is because `class` is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses `className`.

In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase. For example, a click event in JSX is `onClick`, instead of `onclick`. Likewise, `onchange` becomes `onChange`. While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward.



### **Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags**

So far, you’ve seen how JSX differs from HTML in a key way with the use of `className` vs. `class` for defining HTML classes.

Another important way in which JSX differs from HTML is in the idea of the self-closing tag.

In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag: `<div></div>`; the closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing. However, there are special instances in HTML called “self-closing tags”, or tags that don’t require both an opening and closing tag before another tag can start.

For example the line-break tag can be written as `<br>` or as `<br />`, but should never be written as `<br></br>`, since it doesn't contain any content.

In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as `<br />` in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A `<div>`, on the other hand, can be written as `<div />` or `<div></div>`. The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the `<div />`. You will see in later challenges that this syntax is useful when rendering React components.



### **Create a Stateless Functional Component**

Components are the core of React. Everything in React is a component and here you will learn how to create one.

There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a *stateless functional component*. The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.)

To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or `null`. One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter. Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX:

```jsx
const DemoComponent = function() {
  return (
    <div className='customClass' />
  );
};
```

After being transpiled, the `<div>` will have a CSS class of `customClass`.

Because a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page. This is one of the key advantages of the component architecture React provides. It allows you to compose your UI from many separate, isolated components. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces.



### **Create a React Component**

The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 `class` syntax. In the following example, `Kitten` extends `React.Component`:

```jsx
class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
```

This creates an ES6 class `Kitten` which extends the `React.Component` class. So the `Kitten` class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with these terms yet, they will be covered in greater detail in later challenges. Also notice the `Kitten` class has a `constructor` defined within it that calls `super()`. It uses `super()` to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case `React.Component`. The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the `class` keyword. It is best practice to call a component's `constructor` with `super`, and pass `props` to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly. For now, know that it is standard for this code to be included. Soon you will see other uses for the constructor as well as `props`.



### **Write a Simple Counter**

You can design a more complex stateful component by combining the concepts covered so far. These include initializing `state`, writing methods that set `state`, and assigning click handlers to trigger these methods.

------

The `Counter` component keeps track of a `count` value in `state`. There are two buttons which call methods `increment()` and `decrement()`. Write these methods so the counter value is incremented or decremented by 1 when the appropriate button is clicked. Also, create a `reset()` method so when the reset button is clicked, the count is set to 0.

**Note:** Make sure you don't modify the `className`s of the buttons. Also, remember to add the necessary bindings for the newly-created methods in the constructor.

**Solution**

```react
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
    // Change code below this line
    this.increment = this.increment.bind(this)
    this.decrement = this.decrement.bind(this)
    this.reset = this.reset.bind(this)
    // Change code above this line
  }
  // Change code below this line
    reset() {
      this.setState({
        count: 0
      })
    }
    increment() {
      this.setState(state => ({
        count: state.count + 1
      }));
    }

    decrement() {
      this.setState(state => ({
        count: state.count - 1
      }))
    }
  // Change code above this line
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button className='inc' onClick={this.increment}>Increment!</button>
        <button className='dec' onClick={this.decrement}>Decrement!</button>
        <button className='reset' onClick={this.reset}>Reset</button>
        <h1>Current Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```



### **Create a Controlled Input**

Your application may have more complex interactions between `state` and the rendered UI. For example, form control elements for text input, such as `input` and `textarea`, maintain their own state in the DOM as the user types. With React, you can move this mutable state into a React component's `state`. The user's input becomes part of the application `state`, so React controls the value of that input field. Typically, if you have React components with input fields the user can type into, it will be a controlled input form.

------

The code editor has the skeleton of a component called `ControlledInput` to create a controlled `input` element. The component's `state` is already initialized with an `input` property that holds an empty string. This value represents the text a user types into the `input` field.

First, create a method called `handleChange()` that has a parameter called `event`. When the method is called, it receives an `event` object that contains a string of text from the `input` element. You can access this string with `event.target.value` inside the method. Update the `input` property of the component's `state` with this new string.

In the `render` method, create the `input` element above the `h4` tag. Add a `value` attribute which is equal to the `input` property of the component's `state`. Then add an `onChange()` event handler set to the `handleChange()` method.

When you type in the input box, that text is processed by the `handleChange()` method, set as the `input` property in the local `state`, and rendered as the value in the `input` box on the page. The component `state` is the single source of truth regarding the input data.

Last but not least, don't forget to add the necessary bindings in the constructor.

# Redux

As applications grow in size and scope, managing shared data becomes much more difficult. Redux is defined as a "predictable state container for JavaScript apps" that helps ensure your apps work predictably, and are easier to test.

While you can use Redux with any view library, we introduce Redux here before combining it with React in the next set of courses.

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of Redux stores, actions, reducers and middleware to manage data throughout your application.





### **Create a Redux Store**

Redux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of different web technologies, including React.

In Redux, there is a single state object that's responsible for the entire state of your application. This means if you had a React app with ten components, and each component had its own local state, the entire state of your app would be defined by a single state object housed in the Redux `store`. This is the first important principle to understand when learning Redux: the Redux store is the single source of truth when it comes to application state.

This also means that any time any piece of your app wants to update state, it **must** do so through the Redux store. The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to track state management in your app.

------

The Redux `store` is an object which holds and manages application `state`. There is a method called `createStore()` on the Redux object, which you use to create the Redux `store`. This method takes a `reducer` function as a required argument. The `reducer` function is covered in a later challenge, and is already defined for you in the code editor. It simply takes `state` as an argument and returns `state`.

Declare a `store` variable and assign it to the `createStore()` method, passing in the `reducer` as an argument.

**Note:** The code in the editor uses ES6 default argument syntax to initialize this state to hold a value of `5`. If you're not familiar with default arguments, you can refer to the [ES6 section in the Curriculum](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/set-default-parameters-for-your-functions) which covers this topic.

**Solution:**

```Redux
const reducer = (state = 5) => {
  return state;
}

// Redux methods are available from a Redux object
// For example: Redux.createStore()
// Define the store here:

let store = Redux.createStore(reducer);
```





### **Get State from the Redux Store**

The Redux store object provides several methods that allow you to interact with it. For example, you can retrieve the current `state` held in the Redux store object with the `getState()` method.

------

The code from the previous challenge is re-written more concisely in the code editor. Use `store.getState()` to retrieve the `state` from the `store`, and assign this to a new variable `currentState`.

**Solution**

```react
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = 5) => state
);

// Change code below this line

let currentState = store.getState()
```



### **Define a Redux Action**

Since Redux is a state management framework, updating state is one of its core tasks. In Redux, all state updates are triggered by dispatching actions. An action is simply a JavaScript object that contains information about an action event that has occurred. The Redux store receives these action objects, then updates its state accordingly. Sometimes a Redux action also carries some data. For example, the action carries a username after a user logs in. While the data is optional, actions must carry a `type` property that specifies the 'type' of action that occurred.

Think of Redux actions as messengers that deliver information about events happening in your app to the Redux store. The store then conducts the business of updating state based on the action that occurred.

------

Writing a Redux action is as simple as declaring an object with a type property. Declare an object `action` and give it a property `type` set to the string `'LOGIN'`.

**Solution**

```react
// Define an action here:

let action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
}
```



### **Define an Action Creator**

After creating an action, the next step is sending the action to the Redux store so it can update its state. In Redux, you define action creators to accomplish this. An action creator is simply a JavaScript function that returns an action. In other words, action creators create objects that represent action events.

------

Define a function named `actionCreator()` that returns the `action` object when called.

**Solution:**

```react
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
}
// Define an action creator here:

function actionCreator() {
  return action;
}
```



### **Dispatch an Action Event**

`dispatch` method is what you use to dispatch actions to the Redux store. Calling `store.dispatch()` and passing the value returned from an action creator sends an action back to the store.

Recall that action creators return an object with a type property that specifies the action that has occurred. Then the method dispatches an action object to the Redux store. Based on the previous challenge's example, the following lines are equivalent, and both dispatch the action of type `LOGIN`:

```js
store.dispatch(actionCreator());
store.dispatch({ type: 'LOGIN' });
```

------

The Redux store in the code editor has an initialized state that's an object containing a `login` property currently set to `false`. There's also an action creator called `loginAction()` which returns an action of type `LOGIN`. Dispatch the `LOGIN` action to the Redux store by calling the `dispatch` method, and pass in the action created by `loginAction()`.

**Solution:**

```react
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = {login: false}) => state
);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};

// Dispatch the action here:

store.dispatch(loginAction())
```



### **Handle an Action in the Store**

After an action is created and dispatched, the Redux store needs to know how to respond to that action. This is the job of a `reducer` function. Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A `reducer` takes `state` and `action` as arguments, and it always returns a new `state`. It is important to see that this is the **only** role of the reducer. It has no side effects — it never calls an API endpoint and it never has any hidden surprises. The reducer is simply a pure function that takes state and action, then returns new state.

Another key principle in Redux is that `state` is read-only. In other words, the `reducer` function must **always** return a new copy of `state` and never modify state directly. Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, you are responsible for enforcing it in the code of your reducer functions. You'll practice this in later challenges.

------

The code editor has the previous example as well as the start of a `reducer` function for you. Fill in the body of the `reducer` function so that if it receives an action of type `'LOGIN'` it returns a state object with `login` set to `true`. Otherwise, it returns the current `state`. Note that the current `state` and the dispatched `action` are passed to the reducer, so you can access the action's type directly with `action.type`.

**Solution:**

```react
const defaultState = {
  login: false
};

const reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  // Change code below this line
if(action.type === 'LOGIN') {
  return {
    login: true
  }
} else {
  return state;
}
  // Change code above this line
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};
```
